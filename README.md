# Containers

This repository contains definition files for creating Singularity/Apptainer containers.

The documentation for the RoboCup container [lives here](https://github.com/LASR-at-Home/Base/blob/main/common/document_lasr/web/docs/guides/container.md), it is advised that you view this by launching the document_lasr web interface.
